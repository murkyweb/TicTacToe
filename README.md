# TicTacToe

A simple tic-tac-toe game made with HTML, CSS and JS.

In this project I got some good practice with using Factory Functions and the Module pattern. I also learned how useful private variables and private functions can be.

This project was created for the [Tic Tac Toe assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe) as part of The Odin Project.
